Input 2 numbers from user and print their sum.
num1 = int(input("Enter first number:"))
num2 = int(input("Enter your second number:"))
sum = num1+num2
print("The sum of two numbers is:",sum)

Program to find the average of two numbers
num1 = int(input ("ener first number: "))
num2 = int(input("enter your second number:"))
average = (num1 + num2)/2
print("Average your two numbers is:",average)

# Take a number as input, convert it to float and print both the original and converted values with their data type.
# k = 3  (int)
# p = 23.3  (float)
num = int(input("Enter your number:"))
converted_val = float(num)
print("original value is :",num , "Datatype:",type(num))
print("converted val is:",converted_val, "Datatype:",type(converted_val))

# write a program that take two numbers and print: 
# their sum, difference & product
# weather the first number is grater than the second.

num1 = int(input("Enter your num1:"))
num2 = int(input("Enter your num2:"))
sum = (num1+num2)
diff = (num1-num2)
product = (num1*num2)
print("Sum of two numbers:",sum)
print("diff of two numbers:",diff)
print("product of two numbers:",product)
max = (num1>num2)
print("max_num:",num1>num2)
