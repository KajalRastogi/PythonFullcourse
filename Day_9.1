#Automating File Tasks (copy,Rename,Delete)
# Copy file
# import shutil
# shutil.copy("demo.txt","backup_demo.txt")


# Rename file
# import os
# os.rename("demo.txt","backup_demo.txt")

# Delete file
# import os
# os.remove("oldfile.txt")

#copy notes.txt to notes_backup.txt.
#rename temp.txt to final.txt.
#ask user for a file name and copy it to a backup folder.

#Real-life Mini Example : Kajal's Daily Log App
#some office laptops have such scripts in the background when user logs in.
